This is the repository for the paper **"Evaluating Digital Polarization in Multi-Party Systems: Evidence from the German Bundestag"** by Amber Chin, Carolina Coimbra Vieira, and Jisu Kim (2022).

## Project Overview
We use Twitter data for the year 2020 to identify polarization trends among members of the German Bundestag. Specifically, we evaluate trends on the levels of retweets, mentions, and following-follower relationships. We do this by **(1)** performing a network analysis for each network level and **(2)** performing a sentiment analysis of the Twitter mentions between Bundestag members.
